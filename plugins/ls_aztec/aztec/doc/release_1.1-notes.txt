Aztec Version 1.1 Release Notes

* We have fixed a bug in our communication routines which use MPI.

* Other minor bug fixes.

* We have added certain functionality which allows one to reorder
  vectors in accordance with a user defined matrix ordering (see
  AZ_reorder_vec and AZ_invorder_vec descriptions on pages 38 and 30
  of the User's Guide , respectively).

* The User's Guide has been updated to reflect these changes.

* Figure 4 in the User's Guide has been corrected. In particular, the
  column numbers (in bindx) were not in the correct order and thus do
  not correspond to the nonzero values contained in the val array.
